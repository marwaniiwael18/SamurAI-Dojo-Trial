### 🎯 Your Figma Designs Ready for Code Generation

**Design File**: https://www.figma.com/design/E0aLd4tHBvsU4haKTXctvl/The-SamurAI-DOJO--Copy-

**16 Components Identified**:
1. Landing Page (node-id=22-2) → HomePage.jsx
2. Sign Up Page (node-id=63-2) → SignUpPage.jsx  
3. Sign In Page (node-id=66-75) → SignInPage.jsx
4. Profiling Steps (node-id=66-145, 108-2, 111-20) → Wizard components
5. Dashboard (node-id=66-198) → DashboardPage.jsx
6. Navigation (node-id=1-3, 115-114) → Header/Sidebar
7. Workspace components (node-id=73-177, 73-295) → Team management
8. UI Cards (node-id=117-231, 117-359, 117-482) → Reusable components
9. Analytics (node-id=140-7) → Dashboard analytics

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Enable MCP Server in Figma
```bash
# Run the setup guide
./setup-figma.sh

# Follow the instructions to:
# 1. Open Figma Desktop App
# 2. Enable "Dev Mode MCP Server" in Preferences
# 3. Add MCP server to VS Code
```

### 2. Test Connection
```bash
# Test if MCP server is running
./test-mcp.sh

# Should show: ✅ Figma MCP Server is running
```

### 3. Generate Your First Component
1. **Open your Figma design file**
2. **Select the HomePage frame** (node-id=22-2)
3. **In VS Code chat** (⌥⌘B → Agent mode):
   ```
   Generate React code for my Figma selection as the SamurAI Dojo HomePage with:
   - Hero section with corporate branding
   - Professional blue gradient styling
   - Tailwind CSS styling following our design system
   - Integration with React Router
   - Save as frontend/src/pages/HomePage.jsx
   ```

### 4. Follow the Component Generation Order
**Priority 1**: HomePage → SignUpPage → SignInPage → DashboardPage
**Priority 2**: Profiling wizard components
**Priority 3**: Navigation and layout components
**Priority 4**: Feature-specific components

## 💡 Pro Tips for Better Results

### Optimal Prompts
```
Generate React code for my Figma selection as a SamurAI Dojo [ComponentName] with:

FUNCTIONALITY:
- [Specific features and integrations needed]
- Integration with authStore/userStore/workspaceStore
- API endpoint connections

STYLING:
- SamurAI Dojo corporate blue gradient theme (#3B82F6 to #1E40AF)
- Tailwind CSS utilities only
- Responsive mobile-first design
- Professional security-focused styling

TECHNICAL:
- TypeScript interfaces for props
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Accessibility features (ARIA, keyboard nav)
- Follow existing project patterns

ORGANIZATION:
- Save as frontend/src/[appropriate-path]/[ComponentName].jsx
- Import existing stores and utilities
- Follow our naming conventions
```

### Design System Integration
- Your components will automatically follow the SamurAI Dojo design system
- Corporate authentication styling is pre-configured
- Blue gradient themes and professional layouts
- Security-focused visual elements
- Mobile-responsive patterns

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### MCP Server Not Running
```bash
# Check status
curl -s -f "http://127.0.0.1:3845/mcp"

# If failed:
# 1. Restart Figma Desktop
# 2. Re-enable MCP Server in Preferences
# 3. Wait for confirmation message
```

### VS Code Issues
- Ensure GitHub Copilot is active
- Use Agent mode in chat (⌥⌘B)
- Type `#get_code` to verify MCP tools
- Restart VS Code if needed

## 📊 Expected Workflow

1. **Design Review** → Open Figma design file
2. **Component Selection** → Select specific frame/component
3. **Code Generation** → Use VS Code chat with detailed prompts
4. **Review & Refine** → Test generated component
5. **Integration** → Connect to stores and APIs
6. **Next Component** → Repeat for all 16 components

## 🎯 Success Metrics

- [ ] MCP server running successfully
- [ ] First component (HomePage) generated
- [ ] Authentication pages implemented
- [ ] Dashboard components created
- [ ] Profiling wizard built
- [ ] Full design-to-code workflow established
